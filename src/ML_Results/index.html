        We have utilized a machine learning algorithm over the strain-gene/allele dataset of A. <em>baumannii</em>
        available from
        the PATRIC database that can predict the resistance phenotype of strains. In nutshell, we have used the presence
        or absence of particular genes or alleles as features in predicting the phenotype of strain. We have utilized

        <h3 class="wiki-h wiki-h3">esiB (Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin)</h3>
        <p class="wiki-p">
          esiB encodes for Secretory immunoglobulin A-binding protein (UP_esiB).
          <br /><br />
          GO Molecular function: IgA binding and Metal ion binding
          <br /><br />
          GO Biological function: Negative regulation of immune response and neutrophil activation, and pathogenesis
          <br /><br />
          Complete GO annotation: GO_esiB
          <br /><br />
          According to the study of Pastorello et al. (Ref1_esiB), they concluded that esiB helps in secretion of the
          protein which binds with immunoglobulins in the blood or antibodies helping bacteria escape from neutrophil
          (cell eating bacteria). The neutrophil is the most common White Blood Cells (WBC) in the human body, so these
          proteins help the bacterial pathogen in escaping the immune system pathway in the patients of Urinary Tract
          Infections. The study also concluded that esiB is preferentially associated with extraintestinal strains,
          while the gene is rarely found in either intestinal or nonpathogenic strains.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: The presence and importance of this gene in the case of patients with Urinary Tract Infection (one
          of the major Hospital Acquired Infections) make it an important target/gene to explore using wet-lab
          experiments in the case of A. baumannii.
        </p>
        <h3 class="wiki-h wiki-h3">aroP (Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin)</h3>
        <p class="wiki-p">
          aroP encodes for Aromatic amino acid transport protein. It is a permease that is involved in the transport
          across the cytoplasmic membrane of the aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan),
          (UP_aroP).
          <br /><br />
          GO Molecular function: Transmembrane transporter activity of aromatic amino acids
          <br /><br />
          GO Biological function: Amino acids transport
          <br /><br />
          GO Cellular Component: Integral component of Plasma membrane
          <br /><br />

          Complete GO annotation: GO_aroP
          <br /><br />
          Since aroP helps in encoding protein responsible for transportation aromatic amino acids, therefore it is
          related to very basic cellular functions. Amino acids are important for the process of transcription and
          translation, their transportation plays an important role in these functions.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: There is a lack of studies conducted for exploring the functioning of aroP in the context of A.
          baumannii (UP2_aroP), which makes it a novel and important target pathway to be explored for using wet-lab
          experiments, especially because it is involved in the basic cellular process i.e. amino acid transport.
        </p>
        <h3 class="wiki-h wiki-h3">tnsB (Ciprofloxacin)</h3>
        <p class="wiki-p">
          tnsB encodes for Transposon Tn7 transposition protein, which are very special proteins helping in cutting,
          pasting, and making copies of DNA in the chromosome (UP_tnsB).
          <br /><br />
          GO Molecular function: DNA Binding, and Transposase activity
          <br /><br />
          GO Biological function: DNA Integration and DNA-mediated transposition
          <br /><br />
          GO Cellular Component: Cytoplasmic membrane
          <br /><br />
          Complete GO annotation: GO_tnsB
          <br /><br />
          Ciprofloxacin acts by inhibition of DNA replication by inhibiting bacterial DNA topoisomerase and DNA-gyrase.
          Transposons help in DNA strand breakage which is also carried out by topoisomerase. These facts make it very
          clear that tnsB is an important gene and target in the context of DNA replication and is involved in a similar
          mechanism as that of Ciprofloxacin.
          <br /><br />
          Tn7 class transposon proteins are associated with carbapenem-resistance in A. baumannii (Ref1_tnsB). The study
          by Rose (Ref2_tnsB), discovered a novel Tn7-related transposon, TnAbaR1 which contributes to the accumulation
          and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes. According to their study, Tn7 is a well-studied, highly
          promiscuous cut-and-paste transposon, found in a variety of bacteria and mainly important for resistance to
          antibiotics such as trimethoprim and streptomycin.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: The involvement of tnsB in being a cause of resistance to several antibiotics makes it an
          important target and pathway to be explored especially in the context of our novel protein-based therapeutic
          and our pathogen of interest, A. baumannii.

        <h3 class="wiki-h wiki-h3">xerC (Ciprofloxacin) </h3>
        <p class="wiki-p">
          xerC encodes for tyrosine recombinase, which acts by catalyzing the cutting and rejoining of the recombining
          DNA molecules.
          <br /><br />
          GO Molecular function: DNA binding, Site-specific recombinase activity
          <br /><br />
          GO Biological function: Cell cycle, Cell division, and Chromosome segregation
          <br /><br />
          GO Cellular Component: Cytoplasm
          <br /><br />
          Complete GO annotation: GO_xerC
          <br /><br />
          It binds cooperatively to specific DNA consensus sequences that are separated from XerD binding sites by a
          short central region, forming the heterotetrameric XerC-XerD complex is essential to convert dimers of the
          bacterial chromosome into monomers to permit their segregation at cell division. It also contributes to the
          segregational stability of plasmid. (UP_xerC)
          <br /><br />
          During the recombination phase, this complex catalyzes two consecutive pairs of strand exchanges, implying
          that specific pairs of active sites are sequentially switched on and off in the recombinase tetramer to ensure
          that appropriate DNA strands will be exchanged at both reaction steps. These findings have been made for E.
          coli and it would be interesting to check for the same in the case of A. baumannii.
          <br /><br />
          According to the study related to A. baumannii conducted by Lin et al. (Ref1_xerC), they concluded that XerC
          and XerD are functional proteins and participate in horizontal dissemination of resistant genes among
          bacteria. The horizontal dissemination or transfer of resistance genes is a major cause of the increase in
          Antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the study conducted by Merino et al. (Ref2_xerC), finds that DNA
          recombination through the Xer system in plasmids requires XerC and XerD (recombinases). DNA recombination
          helps in the natural editing of the bacterial genome and makes the natural process of evolution faster.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: Since A. baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen that is evolving at a faster rate, and as
          mentioned above, xerC helps in DNA recombination which leads to natural editing of the genome, becomes an
          important target or pathway to be explored using wet-lab experiments.

          <br /><br />
          Complete annotation: GO_asnC
          <br /><br />
          The study conducted by Gebhardt et al. (Ref1_asnC), finds the list of around 300 genes which are important for
          the survival and growth of A. baumannii, and find two AsnC/Lrp family regulators as putative transcriptional
          regulators.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: The involvement of asnC in amino acid binding and impacting the process of transcription makes it
          an interesting pathway to be explored using wet-lab experiments. Like, aroP, it helps bacteria in performing
          basic cellular functions which are essential for survival and growth.

          It is involved in the uptake of Putrescine, and according to a study conducted by Terui et al. (Ref1_puuP) it
          helps in the import of putrescine to be utilized as an energy resource in absence of glucose. Further, it has
          a biological process of helping in the cellular response to DNA damage, and given the fact that Levofloxacin
          is involved in the mechanism of DNA replication which makes it a very interesting and prospective pathway to
          be explored.
          <br /><br />
          According to the study by Hassan et al. (Ref2_puuP), A. baumannii encodes for the transport protein AceI,
          which confers resistance to chlorhexidine, a widely used antiseptic. They also concluded that several gene
          expression studies have revealed that the aceI gene responsible for encoding AceI protein is induced in A.
          baumannii by the short-chain diamines cadaverine and putrescine. It helps us in understanding the indirect
          involvement of putrescine imported by puuP in antibiotic resistance.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: puuP helps in conferring resistance to chlorhexidine, it would be very important to check for the
          same in the case of Levofloxacin especially for A. baumannii.

        <p class="wiki-p">
          aadB encodes for 2''-aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase (UP_aadB)
          <br /><br />
          It helps in mediating bacterial resistance to kanamycin, gentamicin, dibekacin, sisomicin, and tobramycin by
          adenylate the 2''-hydroxyl group of these antibiotics in K. pneumoniae (UP_Kp_aadB) and kanamycin, gentamicin,
          and tobramycin in E. coli (UP_aadB).
          <br /><br />
          GO Molecular function: Aminoglycoside 2''-nucleotidyltransferase activity, and Metal ion binding
          <br /><br />
          GO Biological function: Response to antibiotic and Antibiotic resistance
          <br /><br />
          Complete annotation: GO_aadB
          <br /><br />
          aadB is a resistance-conferring gene which is confirmed by one of the most essential and relevant databases
          i.e. The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD). It works by the mechanism of antibiotic
          inactivation and confers resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics (CARD_aadB).
          <br /><br />
          The study conducted by Rizk et al. (Ref1_aadB) involves the collection of clinical samples of A. baumannii
          strains from intensive care units (ICUs) patients with suspected hospital-acquired infections followed by
          checking them for resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. The study concluded that the most common prevalent
          resistant genes among A. baumannii resistance to aminoglycosides was aadB with a contribution towards
          antibiotic resistance as high as 42%. Since this study involves strains taken from hospitals with suspected
          infections, it makes it essential for our novel protein-based drug to be checked for its efficacy against
          aadB.
          <br /><br />
          As per the study by Anderson et al. (Ref2_aadB), in A. baumannii AB5075, a large plasmid (p1AB5075) carries
          aadB, a 2″-nucleotidyltransferase that confers resistance to both tobramycin and gentamicin but not amikacin.
          It is very important in the case of our machine learning approach since our approach ranks aadB as the most
          important feature (gene/allele) in the case of Gentamicin and Tobramycin but not in the case of Amikacin.
          <br /><br />
          The study conducted by Chan et al. (Ref3_aadB), found a novel antibiotic resistance island in A. baumannii by
          analyzing genomes of several isolates collected from the US hospital system. They further concluded that after
          sequencing the genomes to completion, they found tobramycin-resistance gene aadB.
          <br /><br />
          Si-Tuan et al., (Ref4_aadB) characterized the genome of the A. baumannii strain DMS06669 which was isolated
          from the sputum of a male patient with hospital-acquired pneumonia, and identified genes related to antibiotic
          resistance. They find aadB which is majorly resistant to gentamicin, as one of the genes responsible for
          conferring resistance in the strain.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: These several studies make it very clear that aadB is an important gene especially considering
          aminoglycoside antibiotics. Moreover, the presence of resistance by aadB to majorly gentamicin and tobramycin
          but not amikacin further validates the effectiveness of our machine learning analysis as aadB was the top
          feature in the first two antibiotics but not in the latter.

          It helps in providing resistance to kanamycin, neomycin, paromomycin, ribostamycin, butirosin, and gentamicin
          B in the case of K. pneumoniae. This enzyme is encoded by the kanamycin and neomycin resistance transposon
          Tn5. Tn5 was originally isolated from K.pneumoniae, but has been transferred to a number of bacteria including
          E.coli. Since it has been transferred to E. coli, it is quite important to check for its relevance in the case
          of A. baumannii.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: There has been a lack of literature studies conducted for neo in the context of A. baumannii, but
          it targets using protein pathway which is similar in mechanism to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Moreover, as
          mentioned before, it would be interesting to check for its relevance in A. baumannii.

          msr(E) is a resistant conferring gene as per the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) and
          provides resistance through antibiotic target alteration (CARD_msrE). Furthermore, as per CARD, Msr(E) is an
          ABC-F subfamily protein expressed to K. pneumoniae that confers resistance to erythromycin and streptogramin B
          antibiotics. It is associated with plasmid DNA. It is also 100% identical to ABC-F type ribosomal protection
          protein Msr(E) which is in multiple species. Since it is associated with plasmid DNA, it becomes an important
          factor in horizontal transfer and dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
          <br /><br />
          Blackwell and Hall (Ref1_msrE) find in their study that macrolide resistance genes msrE and mphE were present
          in an 18.2-kb plasmid of A. baumannii isolate from Singapore which confers resistance to erythromycin and
          tetracycline, both of which follow protein synthesis mechanism.
          <br /><br />
          A study conducted by Karah et al. (Ref2_msrE) concluded that msr(E) is one of the resistance genes present in
          clinical isolates of A. baumannii in Pakistan. The study by Kumburu et al. (Ref3_msrE) utilized Whole Genome
          Sequencing (WGS) to identify resistance-conferring genes in MDR A. baumannii in Tanzania. They found several
          antibiotic resistance genes some of which were present in chromosomes while some on plasmids. msr(E) was
          detected as an antibiotic resistance gene that is present on plasmids and playing an important role in the
          spreading of the resistance.
          <br /><br />
          Similar to the case of aadB, the study conducted by Si-Tuan et al., (Ref4_aadB, Ref4_msrE) identified msr(E)
          which is majorly resistant to streptogramin, which follows the similar mechanism as of aminoglycoside
          antibiotics.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: As shown by several studies, msr(E) is responsible for resistance to several antibiotics like
          macrolide, streptogramin, etc, which follow a similar mechanism to those of aminoglycosides, it becomes
          exciting and interesting to check for its relevance to Gentamicin, Tobramycin, and Amikacin.

          It is a multidrug efflux protein that confers resistance to a wide range of toxic compounds, including
          ethidium, methyl viologen, acriflavine, tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+), benzalkonium, propidium, dequalinium,
          and the aminoglycoside antibiotics streptomycin and tobramycin (UP_emrE).
          <br /><br />
          Further, as per the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), EmrE is a small multidrug transporter
          and works by antibiotic efflux mechanism to confer antibiotic resistance (CARD_emrE).
          <br /><br />
          Importance: emrE is majorly found in P. aeruginosa and E. coli, which makes it quite interesting to check for
          existence on A. baumannii genomes. Moreover, it has been shown to be causing resistance to Tobramycin while
          our machine learning detected it to be an important gene in the case of Gentamicin, so it would also be
          exciting to validate and confirm by wet-lab experiments.

          confirming to literature evidence, cysL is one of the novel genes uncovered by our algorithm responsible for
          antibiotic resistance.
          <br /><br />


          Importance: It would be interesting to check the relevance and importance of cysL in the context of A.

          rmtB encoding protein specifically methylated the N7 position of guanine 1405 in 16S rRNA, and conferring
          resistance to various aminoglycosides (UP_rmtB).
          <br /><br />
          It is a resistance gene as per the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), which works with the
          mechanism of antibiotic target alteration and belongs to the drug class of aminoglycoside antibiotics
          (CARD_rmtB).
          <br /><br />

          Tada et al. (Ref1_rmtB) conducted a study on strains of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolated from patients
          in intensive care units (ICUs) in two medical settings in Vietnam and out of which 71.3% strains were highly
          resistant to amikacin and gentamicin. They further concluded that, 16S rRNA methylase RmtB was produced by 9
          strains (of 101) of A. baumannii and 2 (of 15) strains of P. aeruginosa and 16S rRNA methylase producing
          organism are emerging.
          <br /><br />


          The study by Lee et al. (Ref2_rmtB) analyzed amikacin resistant strains of gram-negative bacteria in Korea and
          concluded that armA and rmtB were genes predominantly responsible for the resistance.
          <br /><br />
          Wachino et al. (Ref3_rmtB) and Wang et al. (Ref4_rmtB) concluded that 16S rRNA methylases, which lead to the
          high-level resistance of various aminoglycosides, can easily transfer to other bacteria since their genes are
          typically present on plasmids. The transfer of genes plays an important role in horizontal gene transfer and
          the dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: Several studies have indicated the spread of aminoglycoside resistance in A. baumannii which is a
          major cause of worry for the researchers. Since our novel drug is protein-based therapeutic, it becomes
          apparent to test our drug for its efficacy against such antibiotic-resistant genes.

          <br /><br />
          Li et al. (Ref1_glmM) analyzed carbapenem-resistant clinical A. baumannii strains. They identified several
          AbaR resistance islands for a better understanding of evolutionary processes contributing to the emergence of
          carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. As per their analysis, phosphoglucosamine mutase (GlmM) was detected in
          type 2, 7, and 10 AbaR islands. It is important to note that GlmM can catalyze the conversion of
          glucosamine-6-phosphate to glucosamine-1-phosphate, which is an essential step in the formation of the cell
          wall precursor UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (Ref2_glmM).
          <br /><br />
          Kenyon and Lee (Ref3_glmM) analyzed the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides which are major
          immunogenic components of the bacterial cell envelope. They further mentioned that GlmM is required for the
          synthesis of UDP-D-GlcpNAc.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: There are several studies stating that glmM encodes for the formation of cell wall precursors, and
          it has been detected as one of the top features in the case of Ceftriaxone which also works with the mechanism
          of bacterial cell wall synthesis. So, our machine learning algorithm has identified genes involved in the
          pathway of antibiotics.

          It is involved in the mechanism of Acetylglucosaminyltransferase which is important for cell wall mechanism as
          mentioned in the case of glmM.
          <br /><br />
          The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) provides several evidences for the involvement of mshA
          in antibiotics targeting cell wall mechanisms. Mutations in mshA result in the inactivation of antibiotics and
          it works by the mechanism of antibiotic target alteration (CARD1_mshA).
          <br /><br />
          As mentioned above, mshA is glycosyltransferase and is involved in the first step of mycothiol biosynthesis.
          This is a step that is required for growth in M. tuberculosis and resistance has been in the gene to
          isoniazid, which is antibiotic inhibiting mycobacterial cell wall (CARD2_mshA). Further, the mutations in mshA
          confer resistance to isoniazid in M. tuberculosis (CARD3_mshA).
          <br /><br />
          Importance: Our machine learning approach identifies allele of mshA as one of the most important features in
          predicting resistance phenotype of strain, which in accordance with literature evidence related to mutations
          in mshA causing antibiotic resistance. Moreover, it has been detected as one of the most important genes in
          the case of Ceftriaxone, which also works with mechanisms of bacterial cell wall synthesis.

          <br /><br />

          Complete GO annotation: GO_relE
          <br /><br />
          relE encodes for mRNA interferase, and mRNA interferases play a role in bacterial persistence to antibiotics;
          overexpression of this protein induces persisters resistant to ciprofloxacin and ampicillin (UP_relE,
          Ref1_relE).
          <br /><br />
          relE is a part of type II toxin-antitoxin system relBE wherein it is toxin and relB is anti-toxin. In presence
          of unfavorable conditions, toxin relE sharply increases persisters (cells that neither grow nor die in the
          presence of bactericidal agents) and are largely responsible for high levels of biofilm tolerance to
          antimicrobials (CARD_relE). So it blocks the process of mRNA to protein conversion inhibiting cell growth. The
          increase in biofilm tolerance makes it difficult for antibiotics to reach the bacteria for necessary action.
          <br /><br />
          Pourhajibagher et al. (Ref2_relE) utilized the concept of this toxin-antitoxin system, relBE, for designing
          Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy as an alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy using in-silico
          modeling and bioinformatics analysis.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: There are several studies indicating the involvement of relE in being responsible for antibiotic
          resistance, so it makes it interesting to look for its relevance in the case of A. baumannii using wet-lab
          experiments.

          <br /><br />
          The study conducted by Koenigs et al. (Ref1_tufA) showed for the first time that A. baumannii binds to
          host-derived plasminogen with help of the translation elongation factor Tuf as a moonlighting
          plasminogen-binding protein that is exposed on the outer surface of A. baumannii. This binding phenomenon is
          at least partly dependent on lysine residues and ionic interactions. Once bound to Tuf, plasminogen can be
          converted to active plasmin and proteolytically degrade fibrinogen as well as the key complement component
          C3b. Therefore they concluded that Tuf acts as a multifunctional protein that may contribute to the virulence
          of A. baumannii by aiding in dissemination and evasion of the complement system.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: The results of the above study clearly indicates the importance of Tuf protein is increasing and
          contributing to the virulence of A. baumannii. It would be interesting to explore more about the functioning
          and mechanism of this protein in the context of our novel protein-based drug-using wet-lab experiments.

          yafQ is working in a similar mechanism that of relE i.e. working as a toxin-antitoxin pair. YafQ protein pairs
          with DinJ. which seems to play a role in biofilm formation. mRNA interferases play a role in bacterial
          persistence to antibiotics (UP_yafQ). Since it helps in biofilm formation and biofilm can decrease the amount
          of antibiotics reaching the bacterial cell, therefore it is indirectly responsible for increasing antibiotic
          resistance.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: It has not been explored much in the literature, and it would be really interesting to explore its
          working in the context of A. baumannii along with relE as well.

          cell membrane and decreased binding of polymyxin B. It works by the mechanism of antibiotic target alteration
          (CARD_eptA).
          <br /><br />
          The study conducted by Gerson et al. (Ref1_eptA) concluded that mutations in eptA were associated with
          colistin resistance in A. baumannii. Trebsoc et al. (Ref2_eptA) suggested that direct targeting of the
          homologous PetN transferases PmrC/EptA may have the potential to overcome colistin resistance in A. baumannii.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: eptA has been known to provide resistance to polymyxin B which works with the mechanism of
          membrane disruption. It has been identified as one of the top genes for Ceftazidime which also works with the
          mechanism of cell wall synthesis. Further, it has been studied to play a role in colistin resistance which

          Mechanism: Sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with
          para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Trimethoprim blocks the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic
          acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the required enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase. So, in a nutshell,
          combinations of these drugs mainly work with folate synthesis.
          <br /><br />
          In bacteria, antibacterial sulfonamides act as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase
          (DHPS), an enzyme involved in folate synthesis.

          precursor of folate derivatives (UP_folP).
          <br /><br />
          As per the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), point mutations in dihydropteroate synthase,
          folP prevent sulfonamide antibiotics from inhibiting its role in folate synthesis, thus conferring sulfonamide
          resistance (CARD_folP). It works with the mechanism of antibiotic target alteration. Our machine learning
          approach identified folP and its alleles as the topmost important features which further validate the efficacy
          of our algorithm.
          <br /><br />
          Importance: The detection of folP in the case of antibiotics working with folate disruption by machine
          learning algorithm is a very important indication for the efficacy of the approach. It would be very
          interesting to check for the impact of folP in establishing resistance to our novel protein-based drug.

          Mechanism: Ampicillin/sulbactam is a combination of a β-lactam antibiotic and a β-lactamase inhibitor.
          Ampicillin works by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis.
          Sulbactam blocks the enzyme which breaks down ampicillin and thereby allows ampicillin to attack and kill the
          bacteria.
          <br /><br />
          Beta-lactam enzymes are produced by some bacteria that are responsible for their resistance to beta-lactam
